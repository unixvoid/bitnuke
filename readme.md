security token (as header)
/remove     ::  takes a POST of url-encoded `token`(token) and `sec`(security token)
/supload    ::  takes a POST of multipart data to be stored persistent. returns a token
/compress   ::  takes a POST of multipart form (a url) to be stored. returns a token
/{data}     ::  a token previously generated by '/upload', '/compress'. returns data
